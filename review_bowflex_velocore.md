## Abstract

The Bowflex VeloCore 16" receives a NPS of 10 and was selected based on 2 unique Kano Model Exciter features.

## Persona

John is a hobby cyclist that cycled both outdoors and indoors when he had a lot of free time but stopped cycling once life became too busy and he lost access to his company gym during Covid.

When he was actively cycling he would spend time at the gym doing cardio including cycling, stair stepping and running on the treadmill. Outside, he could cycle 100 miles in a day on weekends and rode in an organized century (100 miles).

John likes using technology to make his experience better. Given how much time he has spent on the gym, before the iPhone, he purchased stand-alone video players like the River to load videos for enterntainment but found it too cumbersome to use. He has used gym bikes that show pepole cycling through the country side but would really rather just watch movies and TV shows of his choosing. John was been award more than one US Patent.

Other exercises are not important. While some bikes support other exercies, John's primary goal is cycling, potentially up to 100 miles at a time, not any other other workout initially. If cycling works out well, he may consider other exercises from the same vendor, but at that time he may be up for replacement or additional hardware.

John's elasticity of demand is inelastic. His goal is to get in shape and to do that he need the right equipment. Saving money but not getting in shape would be a failure.

## Buying Decision - Features and Pricing

### The Contenders

When making a purchasing design, the Peloton was at the top of the list. THe following were considered:

1. [Peloton Bike+ at $2,495 (now on sale at $1,995)](https://www.onepeloton.com/bike-plus)
1. [Peloton Bike at $1,495 (now on sale at $1,195)](https://www.onepeloton.com/bike)
1. [Bowflex VeloCore Bike 22" screen at $2,199](https://www.bowflex.com/bikes/velocore.html)
1. [Bowflex VeloCore Bike 16" screen at $1,499 sale (now back to $1,799)](https://www.bowflex.com/bikes/velocore.html)
1. [Bowflex C7 Bike at $799 clearance (from $1,299)](https://www.bowflex.com/bikes/c7/100926.html)

NordicTrack was looked at but not seriously considered since it didn't appear to have features that were lacking in the Peloton and Bowflex options. While some users have gotten some streaming services to work on the NordicTrack iFit tablet, it is not officially supported and NordicTrack has since locked users out of using the feature. Overall, this is a major negative relative to Bowflex which has official, built-in support for streaming servies, like modern televisions.

### The Decision - Kano Model and PNP

Regarding which bike to get, the decision was two parts.

Bowflex VeloCore was selected due to two Kano Model Excitement Features.

1. Better Hardware - Leaning Mode: The Bowflex VeloCore is unqiue in that it has a "leaning" mode allowing the bike to tilt left and right like a real bike. John was not expecting a leaning mode but it is an exciting feature given his outdoor biking experience.
2. Better Software - Video Streaming: The Bowflex VeloCore can stream Netflex, Hulu and Disney+. John is an avid Star Wars and Marvel fan and being able to steam Disney+ meets his long running desire for entertainment during exercise.

The next decision was between the 22" and 16" monitors. 16" was selected because:

1. It felt big enough given his streaming on his 16" screen laptop.
2. It was on sale for $1,499 which was $700 less than the 22" at $2,199.

The thought was to purchase the 16" first and if it was too small, exchange it.

The $199 set up was not included because John wanted to be able to review the installation process.

## Review

### Installation Review

The bike was shipped relatively quickly in a few boxes:

1. Bike frame (no monitor)
1. Monitor
1. Exercise mat - free but not really necessary since John already had one.
1. Comfort seat - not really necessary but wanted to it for good experience just in case given expeirence with road bike

Installation was done part time over 3 days:

* Day 1: attach floor stands, handlebars and seat stem
* Day 2: install monitor stem, pedals and sseat
* Day 3: install monitor, dumbbell holders and water bottle holders

It was a bit intimidating at first because the bike frame is very heavy and there was a desire not to tip it over or damage it. Once the foot stands were attached, it went much easier.

Overall, instructions were easy to follow and complete. Some extra parts were included. It was nice that no parts were missing.

The only potential downsides were the tools supplied and the water bottle cages.

The tools that had issues were:

1. the two hex wrenches (like screw drivers)
1. the small wrench (like two sided moneky wrench)

Using the supplied tools would have made the installation much harder, but luckily I had:

1. Canondale portable folding tool set with hex wrenches
1. Rachet wrench set with 13mm and 17mm sockets

Companies always try to skim on installation-only tools so it's good to have some of your own. Tools that were useful included:

1. Large wrench for pedals
1. Phillips head screw driver

Also, the water bottle cages are lower quality that most of the other pieces on the bike which are very solid. It can be difficult to get water bottles into the changes. I will look at swapping them out for ones similar to ones that I use on my road bike which I find easier to use when cycling.

Overall, the documentation was good and the set up was easy, due to having my own tools.

### Usage Review

The review has a few pieces:

1. Overall Hardware feel - The bike is super solid. The bike was very solid and leaned well. When the bike is locked, it feels super stable. The only the time bike didn't feel completely safe was when was was pedaling hard out of the saddle in leaning mode, so when I'm pedaling hard out of the saddle, I disable the leaning mode. After purchasing the Bowflex, I heard the brand was owned by Nautilis which gave me great confidence in the equipment as they make gear I've used in professional gyms.
1. Great Pedals - The pedals a great mention because one side uses slips for regular shoes while the other side uses Shimano's SPD design which are typically used on mountain bikes. For my roadbike, I use SPD pedals and cleats because I want a shoe that I can walk around in. The fact these come with SPD pedals instead of the Look Delta cleat design that Peloton uses felt like they were focusing on my persona. This isn't that important as long as the pedals can be changed but it's a nice touch since the Peloton uses the a Delta clipless pedal that doesn't also offer clips for riding with regular shoes.
1. The water bottle cages are the only pieces that feel of lower quality and were a bit difficult insert water bottles into while cycling. I will look to replace them with ones typically used on outdoor bikes.
1. Software upgrade - The first thing the software does is show you it is powered by Android and downloads updates with ZIP files for Hulu, Netflix and Disney+ which provided a good feeling.
1. JRNY App - it's very nice and encouarges you to ride more. It takes the need to choose selections away so I can feel like it will progressively get harder as I get in better shape. It is very complimentary which is nice.
1. Streaming is great. I watched some reruns and performed my 3rd and 4th rides back-to-back because I was watching Episode VI of Obi-Wan for the first time.
1. Music is good too. I tried the music selections and it allowed my to find some great songs, but I still preferred watching shows.
1. The 16" screen felt like it was the perfect size since my face is close enough to it that I don't need it to be huge and my eyes were not wandering around the screen to watch the shows.

Overall, it is an incredible experience:

1. leaning mode makes biking more fun since it's not as monotonus as cycling on a completely fixed bike.
1. leaning mode seemed a bit unstable when I was cycling hard out of the saddle but that may be expected so I'm okay to disable leaning when biking hard out of the saddle.
1. streaming worked really well after logging in with my Disney+ account. Streaming is disabled when not exercising which is okay since the goal is to exercise and streaming services keep track of where you are watching so you can continue watching on another device.
1. I could use my existing Shimano cycling shows with SPD cleats first using the clips and then clipping into the clipless side.
1. I felt no need for a larger screen.

### Net Promoter Score

# Documentation

## Overview

Product management owns the success and failure of a product. Documenation is an essential part of many products that is also often by product management. Product management roles such as "Product Manger" and "Senior Product Manager" can have one or two technical writers reporting to them to create technical documentation.

The product management role is ideal to own product documentation because the product manager:

* owns the design and ease of use of the product
* best undestands the use cases for the product

## Responsibilities

The product manager's responsibilities for documentaiton include:

- [ ] documentation that ships on time with the product
- [ ] documentation that is correct
- [ ] documentation that is easy to understand and does not require a support case to be opened

The product manager can optionally write the documentation, however, in larger organizations, a documentation is available to do the writing.

## Deliverables

Documentation can fit several deliverable formats:

- [ ] Formal documentation such as a Developer Guide
- [ ] Blog article
- [ ] Example apps
